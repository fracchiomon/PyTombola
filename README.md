# PyTombola
An attempt to use Python for playing an Italian version of Bingo: the Tombola

Its best use case is with friends, in videocalls or similar.

At the moment the program is very unstable: I'm working to implement a more efficient generation for the Cartella class, which is still too much primitive.
Next I'd like to implement a GUI using Kivy.
